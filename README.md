Information needed to run the project correctly:

- We are using .NET Core 8.0
- The unbox.exe program (as well as its related files) must be located in the folder: \bin\Debug\net8.0-windows (note that the folder refers to the version of .NET Core used;
  if you prefer to compile the project with another version, consider this when placing unbox.exe in the correct folder)
- The program automatically configures source and destination folders as: ~\Source and ~\Destination, but you can change both by clicking the respective buttons to select the directory (..)
